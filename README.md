# APIs

A lot of times, when we develop applications and software, we either want to access another service's information or don't want to develop our own database of code for a feature. Lucky for us, APIs exist for just about every company and topic you can think of.

API stands for Application Programming Interface, it is a set of pre-defined methods, functions, definitions, and data used to communicate between software. APIs provide the building blocks for software; the Ruby language itself is actually just an API we all use. 

I've often referred to APIs as a specific library from which we can call specific information. Many APIs take on this form and are organized as hashes, with key-value pairs corresponding with different information waiting to be called. For example, you are developing an app to let people schedule appointments at your hair salon. You can either hard-code a custom calendar into your website, or you could call Google's Calendar API to to automatically create a calendar with details and availability. Most would choose to just call Google's Calendar API because hard-coding calendar functionality would take way too long and Google's API already works right out of the box, with more functionality than you could ever need. 

As mentioned before, there are many APIs out in the world capable of doing anything imaginable. Most large companies have a public API for use; some require special access or payment, some are completely free. When developing your final project, see if there's an API you can use to make your life easier.
